        "p1": "You're at the Italian border. The officer asks for your residence permit. You open Apple Wallet, scroll past your credit cards and last month's boarding pass, and realize: your permesso di soggiorno isn't there. It never was. Apple Wallet doesn't store identity documents. It doesn't store insurance cards, vaccination records, or visa PDFs. It stores exactly what Apple has decided counts as a \"pass,\" and your critical documents don't make the list.",
        "p2": "This is the gap between expectation and reality. Apple Wallet handles tap-to-pay beautifully. It syncs boarding passes automatically. But the moment you need something that isn't a payment card or a .pkpass file from a participating provider, you're searching through Photos, Files, or your email. The passes you do have appear scattered by date added rather than organized into trips. You can't share a hotel confirmation with your partner. You can't set a reminder for when your passport expires.",
        "p3": "The solution isn't to abandon Apple Wallet. It's to add specialist apps that solve the problems Apple ignores. Here are the alternatives worth installing in 2025.",
        "h2_1": "For documents Apple Wallet won't accept",
        "p4": "<strong>Folio</strong> stores everything Apple Wallet refuses: passports, residence permits, driver's licenses, insurance policies, vaccination certificates, medical records. Photograph a document and Folio extracts the key data automatically. Set it up once and you get notifications before documents expire. When someone needs to see your insurance details, generate a secure link that expires after they've viewed it.",
        "img_alt": "Folio app showing BBVA payment card with details, Italian residence permit with extracted data, and trip timeline with Barcelona hotel bookings and flight tickets",
        "p5": "The real difference shows when you travel. Apple Wallet displays your boarding pass. Folio shows your entire trip in chronological order: the flight, the hotel in Barcelona, the Sagrada Familia tickets, the train to Tarragona, the return journey. Tap any item and the barcode or QR code is ready to scan. Everything works offline because the documents live on your device with end-to-end encryption. For families, shared folders let everyone access the same documents without messaging files back and forth. <0>Available free on iOS and Android.</0>",
        "h2_2": "For managing multiple payment cards",
        "p6": "<strong>Curve</strong> solves a different problem: too many cards. Link all your Visa and Mastercard accounts to Curve, then add just Curve to Apple Wallet. At checkout, one card handles everything. Later, you decide which underlying account actually pays. Made a purchase on the wrong card? \"Go Back in Time\" moves the charge up to 30 days later. For people who optimize credit card rewards by category, Curve eliminates the fumbling to find the right card before paying.",
        "p7": "Curve also shows exchange rates before international purchases, unlike Apple Wallet which just charges your bank's rate and reveals the damage on your statement days later. The free tier covers basic card aggregation. Paid tiers add fee-free ATM withdrawals abroad, higher limits, and cashback at selected retailers.",
        "h2_3": "For trips that involve more than a flight",
        "p8": "<strong>TripIt</strong> builds itineraries automatically. Forward any confirmation email to plans@tripit.com and it assembles a master timeline: flights, hotels, restaurant reservations, rental cars, concert tickets. The Pro tier monitors flights for delays and gate changes faster than most airline apps, tracks seat availability for upgrades, and even claims refunds when airlines owe you money. Apple Wallet shows passes in isolation; TripIt shows your entire trip as a story.",
        "p9": "<strong>Pass2U Wallet</strong> handles the passes Apple Wallet rejects. That gym membership with a barcode, the loyalty card from a local shop, the ticket that arrived as a PDF instead of a proper .pkpass file: Pass2U converts images into wallet passes. It's not elegant, but it solves the frustration of passes that exist only as screenshots or email attachments.",
        "h2_4": "Building your stack",
        "p10": "The point isn't to replace Apple Wallet. Tap-to-pay through the Secure Element remains the fastest and most secure way to pay. Express Mode for transit cards and keys works better than any third-party app could. But Apple Wallet is a foundation, not a complete solution. Add Folio for documents and trip organization. Add Curve if you juggle multiple cards. Add TripIt if you travel frequently and want everything in one timeline.",
        "p11": "The best digital wallet in 2025 isn't a single app. It's a combination that matches how you actually live. Keep Apple Wallet for payments and passes that work natively. Fill the gaps with apps that solve the specific problems Apple hasn't addressed. The result is fewer \"where did I save that?\" moments and more confidence that everything you need is one tap away."

        "img_alt": "Age verification flow in Folio: verify your age screen, face verification with checklist, and document selection with passport and driving licence options",
        "h2_1": "Why age verification is getting serious",
        "p3": "The \"click to confirm\" approach never really worked. Anyone could lie about their age, and everyone knew it. Now regulators are requiring actual verification for gambling sites, alcohol delivery, adult content, and increasingly, social media. The UK's Online Safety Act, the EU's Digital Services Act, and new laws in US states all push for verification methods that provide real confidence, not just a checkbox.",
        "p4": "For users, this means more friction when accessing age-restricted services. But it also means more protection for young people online. The challenge is finding verification methods that work without creating massive privacy risks or excluding legitimate users.",
        "h2_2": "The five ways to verify age online",
        "p5": "<strong>Self-declaration</strong> is what you're used to: clicking a button or entering a birth date. It's fast and easy, but it proves nothing. Regulators increasingly reject this as insufficient. If a service still relies only on self-declaration, they're either in an unregulated space or taking a risk.",
        "p6": "<strong>Database checks</strong> verify your information against existing records like credit bureaus or voter rolls. You enter your name, address, and birth date; the system checks if it matches someone real. This works well if you have a credit history, but young adults and people new to a country often can't be verified this way.",
        "p7": "<strong>Document verification</strong> means uploading your ID, passport, or driver's license. The service scans the document, extracts your birth date, and often matches your face to the photo. This provides high confidence but raises obvious privacy concerns: do you really want to give your passport to every website?",
        "p8": "<strong>Face-based age estimation</strong> uses AI to guess your age from a selfie. You don't upload any documents; the system just estimates whether you look old enough. It's quick and doesn't reveal your identity, but it's less accurate. Someone who looks young might get rejected even if they're 30, while a mature-looking 16-year-old might slip through.",
        "p9": "<strong>Reusable age credentials</strong> are the privacy-focused option. You verify your age once with a trusted provider, then receive a digital credential that proves \"this person is over 18\" without revealing your name, birth date, or any other details. Each time you need to prove your age, you share just that one fact.",
        "h2_3": "Privacy tradeoffs you should know about",
        "p10": "Here's the uncomfortable truth: most age verification creates a record of what you're trying to access. If you upload your passport to verify age on an adult website, that site now has your identity linked to your visit. Database checks create logs. Even face scans can be stored.",
        "p11": "This is why privacy advocates push for anonymous age credentials. With this approach, the verification provider confirms your age but doesn't know which services you're accessing. The service confirms you're old enough but doesn't learn your identity. No one has the complete picture.",
        "p12": "When choosing how to verify your age, consider: what information am I sharing? Who stores it? Can they link my identity to my activity? The answers vary dramatically between methods.",
        "h2_4": "Where you'll encounter age verification",
        "p13": "<strong>Gambling and gaming</strong> have the strictest requirements. Online casinos and betting sites in most countries must verify your identity before you can play, not just your age. This typically means full document verification plus address confirmation. Video games with loot boxes are increasingly included in these rules.",
        "p14": "<strong>Alcohol and tobacco delivery</strong> requires verification at checkout and often again at delivery. When your wine arrives, the courier may need to scan your ID before handing it over. Some services let you pre-verify, so deliveries become smoother over time.",
        "p15": "<strong>Social media</strong> is the new battleground. Several countries are pushing for age verification on major platforms to protect children. This is contentious because it could require millions of people to verify their identity just to use everyday apps. How this plays out will shape the future of online privacy.",
        "p16": "<strong>Adult content</strong> is where the strongest new laws apply. The UK and several US states now require robust age verification for pornographic websites. Simple age gates no longer comply. This has driven rapid development in privacy-preserving verification methods, since users understandably don't want to upload their passport to these sites.",
        "p17": "<strong>Financial services</strong> verify age as part of broader identity checks. When you open a bank account or sign up for a crypto exchange, age verification happens automatically alongside identity verification. You rarely notice it as a separate step.",
        "h2_5": "What good age verification looks like",
        "p18": "The best age verification systems share a few characteristics. They're quick, completing in seconds rather than days. They work on mobile, since that's where most people are. They're accessible, not excluding people who don't have driver's licenses or credit histories. And they minimize data collection, asking only for what's necessary.",
        "p19": "For privacy-conscious users, look for services that offer anonymous age credentials or face-based estimation. These prove your age without creating a permanent record of your identity linked to the service. For high-stakes situations like gambling or financial services, expect more thorough verification and understand that's appropriate given the risks involved.",
        "p20": "Folio supports all these verification methods. For businesses, it means choosing the right approach for each situation, using thorough verification where regulations require it, and lighter methods where privacy matters more. For users, it means one verification can work across multiple services through reusable credentials, so you're not uploading your passport to every site that asks. Learn more about <0>Folio's age compliance solutions</0>.",
        "p21": "Age verification is becoming a standard part of life online. The technology exists to do it well, protecting young people while respecting everyone's privacy. The question is whether businesses and regulators will choose the approaches that balance both, or settle for methods that create unnecessary privacy risks."

        "p2": "App in the Air did something simple but valuable. It watched your email, found your flight confirmations, and built your itinerary automatically. It told you when gates changed. It warned you about delays. It tracked your boarding pass barcode so you could board without fumbling through emails. For frequent flyers, it felt like having a personal travel assistant.",
        "p3": "Now it's gone, and most alternatives miss the point. They're either too simple (just a calendar with flights) or too complicated (full trip planning suites when you just want to know if your flight's on time). <0>Folio Wallet</0> takes a different approach: it starts with your documents.",
        "h2_1": "What Folio does differently",

        "p6": "Shared folders solve the group travel problem. Create a folder for a family trip, invite everyone, and all the documents stay in sync. When someone's flight changes, everyone sees it. When the hotel confirmation arrives, it's there for whoever needs it at check-in.",

        "p7": "The one thing Folio doesn't do yet is real-time flight tracking. The feature App in the Air users miss most: the notifications about delays, gate changes, and arrival times. That's changing. Live updates are coming to Folio, and here's what it will look like:",

        "h2_3": "Why security matters more than you think",

        "p10": "Folio works differently. Your documents are encrypted before they leave your device. We can't read them, even if we wanted to. The encryption key is derived from your Passkey or Recovery Code, something only you have. If Folio ever shut down, your documents remain encrypted, unreadable to anyone without your key.",
        "p11": "For travel documents especially, this matters. Passport copies, ID scans, visa documents: these are exactly what identity thieves look for. Having them scattered across email accounts and random apps creates risk. Having them encrypted in one place, protected by keys only you control, eliminates it.",
        "h2_4": "Making the switch",
        "p12": "If you're moving from App in the Air, here's the reality: you can't import your old data. It's gone with the service. But you can start fresh with better habits.

If you travel frequently and need your passport, visa, and insurance accessible anywhere with real security, Folio combines scanning with encrypted storage designed for identity documents. If you handle contracts and legal documents professionally, Adobe Scan's quality and Acrobat integration justify the ecosystem investment. If you live in Microsoft 365 for work, Lens integrates without adding another app to manage. If you just need to scan a receipt occasionally, Genius Scan is simple and free.",
        "p11": "Most people benefit from two apps: one for sensitive identity documents with proper encryption, and one for everyday scanning where convenience matters more than security. A scanned passport stored in a general-purpose app with weak security is a liability. A grocery receipt doesn't need military-grade protection. Match the app to what you're scanning, and you'll have the right document available exactly when someone asks for it."

        "p1": "You're at the venue entrance. The line is moving. You search your email for \"ticket\" and get 47 results. None of them is the one you need. You try \"concert\" and find last year's show. The person behind you sighs. You scroll frantically through screenshots, then remember the ticket might be in a different email account entirely.",
        "p2": "This happens because tickets are fragmented across a dozen places. And every app that claims to solve this actually makes it worse.",
        "h2_1": "The fragmentation problem",
        "p3": "Look at where your tickets actually live. The concert is in the Ticketmaster app, but you can't export it anywhere else. The conference badge came as an email PDF. The theme park sent a booking confirmation with a barcode buried in the middle of the page. The theater emailed a screenshot. The sports game is in a team-specific app you downloaded once.",
        "p4": "Each ticket is locked in its own silo. When you need one, you have to remember which silo it's in, open the right app or email, and hope you can find it before the line loses patience.",
        "h2_2": "What each app actually does",
        "p5": "<strong>Ticketmaster and Eventbrite</strong> store tickets, but only tickets you bought through them. You can't add a theater ticket or conference badge. They're ticket sellers first, organizers second. If you buy from multiple sources, you still have multiple apps.",
        "p6": "<strong>Apple Wallet and Google Wallet</strong> work great for compatible tickets. Double-tap to access, even from the lock screen. The problem: many events don't support wallet integration. That theme park PDF won't go into Apple Wallet. Neither will most conference badges or smaller venue tickets.",
        "p7": "<strong>Screenshots and email</strong> technically work, but they're unsearchable, unorganized, and easy to lose. Three months from now, you won't remember if that concert ticket was a screenshot, a PDF, or forwarded from someone else.",
        "h2_3": "One place for everything",
        "p8": "<0>Folio</0> takes tickets from anywhere. Forward the email, upload the PDF, photograph the paper ticket. It extracts the event name, date, venue, seat information, and barcode. Everything appears in a timeline sorted by date.",
        "img_alt": "Folio app showing event tickets: La Perle by Dragone with QR code and PortAventura theme park ticket with barcode",
        "p9": "Standing at the venue entrance, you open one app. Your tickets are sorted by date. Today's event is at the top. Tap it. The barcode or QR code is right there, ready to scan. No searching through email. No remembering which app you bought it from. No frantically scrolling through screenshots.",
        "p10": "For theme parks and multi-day events, all the details are visible at a glance: valid dates, age categories, venue address. For concerts and theater, seat information and ticket class appear prominently. The original PDF or image stays attached if you need it, but you rarely do because everything important is already extracted.",
        "p11": "The practical difference: instead of five apps and three email searches, you have one timeline. Whether it's a concert tonight, a conference next week, or a theme park trip next month, everything lives in the same place. Works offline too, so you're not dependent on venue WiFi when you need to show your ticket."

        "p1": "You're at the checkout, ready to use that $50 Starbucks card your aunt gave you last Christmas. You open your wallet app, scroll through dozens of cards, and realize: it expired two weeks ago. The balance is gone. This happens more often than anyone admits. Gift cards worth billions of dollars go unused every year, not because people don't want to spend them, but because they forget they exist or lose track of when they expire.",
        "p2": "The solution is simple: store your gift cards in an app that actually helps you use them. Not all wallet apps are equal, though. Some bury gift cards among loyalty programs and payment methods. Others lack expiration reminders entirely. Here's what to look for and which apps do it best.",
        "h2_1": "What makes a good gift card wallet",
        "p3": "The best gift card apps share three features. First, easy entry: you should be able to scan a card with your camera, import a photo, or type the number manually. Second, expiration tracking: the app should warn you before a card expires, ideally with enough time to actually use it. Third, quick access: when you're at the register, you need the barcode or card number in two taps, not five.",
        "p4": "Security matters too. Gift cards are essentially cash. If someone gets your card number and PIN, they can drain the balance before you notice. A good wallet app protects your cards with encryption and device-based authentication, so even if you lose your phone, your gift cards stay safe.",
        "h2_2": "The best apps for gift card storage",
        "p5": "<strong>Folio</strong> treats gift cards as first-class citizens. Add a card by tapping the + icon, selecting Any Document, then scanning with your camera, choosing an existing photo, importing a PDF, or entering details manually. Once added, you can set expiration dates and get reminders before the deadline approaches. Everything is encrypted end-to-end and protected with passkeys and biometric authentication.",
        "img_alt": "Folio app showing Amazon gift card with barcode, hidden code, $100 balance, and options to share or organize with labels",
        "p6": "What sets Folio apart is organization. Gift cards sit alongside your other important items: payment cards, IDs, insurance documents, event tickets. You can create folders to group cards by store or occasion. When you're at Target, you see your Target gift card immediately, not buried under Starbucks and Amazon cards you won't use today. Shared folders let you give family members access to household gift cards without texting screenshots back and forth. <0>Available free on iOS and Android.</0>",
        "p7": "<strong>Stocard</strong> started as a loyalty card app but handles gift cards too. The interface is clean, scanning works well, and most major retailers are recognized automatically. The downside: Stocard focuses heavily on loyalty programs and shopping offers, so the experience is cluttered if you just want simple gift card storage. There's also no expiration reminder feature, which defeats the main purpose of tracking gift cards digitally.",
        "p8": "<strong>Apple Wallet</strong> accepts gift cards from participating retailers, but the list is limited. If the store has issued a proper .pkpass file, you can add it. If not, you're out of luck. There's no way to manually enter a gift card number or scan a physical card. For iPhone users who happen to receive compatible digital gift cards, it works seamlessly. For everyone else, it's not a complete solution.",
        "p9": "<strong>Google Wallet</strong> has similar limitations. It stores gift cards from supported retailers and integrates with Google Pay for easy checkout. The experience is smooth when it works, but coverage is inconsistent. Many smaller retailers and restaurant chains aren't supported, leaving gaps in your collection.",
        "p10": "<strong>Gyft</strong> takes a different approach: it's primarily a gift card marketplace where you buy, send, and store cards. If you frequently purchase digital gift cards, Gyft keeps them organized and ready to use. The app also offers deals and cashback on certain purchases. The limitation is that Gyft works best with cards bought through its platform. Adding existing physical gift cards is possible but not the app's strength.",
        "h2_3": "Making the most of your gift cards",
        "p11": "Whichever app you choose, a few habits help. Add gift cards immediately when you receive them, not \"later\" when you'll forget. Set expiration reminders if your app supports them, or add calendar events if it doesn't. Check your collection before shopping trips, especially for stores you don't visit often. That $25 Barnes & Noble card from your birthday might be the push you need to finally buy that book.",
        "p12": "For most people, Folio offers the best combination of easy entry, expiration tracking, and organization. It's designed for people who want all their important cards and documents in one secure place, not just gift cards. If you're already using Apple Wallet or Google Wallet for payments and just need gift card support, Stocard or Gyft can fill the gap. The worst option is no app at all, leaving gift cards to expire forgotten in a drawer."
