        { "q": "What credential formats are supported?", "a": "Folio supports W3C Verifiable Credentials in JWT and JSON-LD formats, SD-JWT for selective disclosure, and ISO 18013-5 mDL format for mobile driver licenses. You can choose the format that best fits your use case and regulatory requirements." },
        { "q": "How do I issue credentials via API?", "a": "Use our REST API to issue credentials programmatically. Define your credential schema, prepare the claims data, and make a POST request to the issuance endpoint. The API returns a signed credential that you can deliver to the user." },
        { "q": "Can credentials be revoked?", "a": "Yes. You can revoke any credential at any time through the API or dashboard. Revocation takes effect immediately and verifiers can check revocation status in real time using standard protocols." },
        { "q": "How are credentials delivered to users?", "a": "Credentials can be delivered via QR codes that users scan with their wallet app, deep links that open directly in the wallet, or push notifications for users who already have your app installed." },
        { "q": "What standards does Folio follow?", "a": "Folio implements W3C Verifiable Credentials, W3C DID specifications, OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OpenID4VCI), and EUDI Wallet Architecture standards. This ensures interoperability with other compliant systems." },
        { "q": "Can I customize credential schemas?", "a": "Yes. You can define custom schemas with the exact claims and data types your use case requires. You can also use standard schemas from schema.org or other registries for common credential types." },
        { "q": "Is there batch issuance support?", "a": "Yes. The batch issuance API lets you issue thousands of credentials in a single request. This is useful for organizations issuing credentials to employees, students, or members at scale." }
