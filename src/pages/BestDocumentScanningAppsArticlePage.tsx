        Paper gets lost. Paper gets damaged. Paper stays behind when you need it most. A scanned document travels with you. It lives on your phone, ready whenever you need it. Modern scanning apps make this effortless: snap a photo, and you have a crisp, organized PDF in seconds.

        Your phone camera is already a scanner. But a dedicated app makes the result actually useful. Smart detection. Automatic cropping. Perfect lighting adjustments. The result looks like it came from a professional scanner, not a rushed photo. The best scanning apps go further. They organize your files. They back them up securely. They let you find any document in seconds.

        Not all scanning apps are equal. Here's what matters: scan quality with clear text and sharp edges readable even at small print, PDF export to save and share in the format everyone can open, organization with folders, tags, and search that actually work, security with encryption that matters when you're scanning passports and contracts, and offline access so your documents are there even without internet.

        Security and best practices
      </ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        When you scan a passport, medical record, or contract, you're trusting the app with sensitive information. Look for encryption. Check if data stays on your device or uploads to servers. Review the privacy policy before scanning anything confidential. Folio Wallet uses zero-knowledge encryption. Even we can't read your files. For documents that matter, that's the level of protection you want.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        For better scans, use good lighting with natural light or a bright lamp and avoid shadows. Hold steady for sharper results. Place documents on a flat surface with a contrasting background. Name files immediately so you'll thank yourself later. Back up regularly with cloud sync or export to a secure location.

        Scanning is no longer just about capturing an image. AI now recognizes document types, extracts data, and organizes everything automatically. Soon, a single scan could add an event to your calendar, file an expense report, or verify your identity. The line between scanning and productivity is disappearing. Apps like Folio Wallet are already moving in this direction: turning scanned documents into actionable, organized information.
