        Why you need an ID scanner app and what to look for
      </ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        A regular photo of your ID isn't enough. It's blurry. It has glare. It's hard to read. A dedicated scanner app fixes that. It detects edges automatically. Removes shadows. Adjusts lighting. The result looks like it came from a professional scanner. Many apps also recognize text using OCR. That means you can copy details, search your files, and export data, not just store an image.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        Not all scanner apps are equal. Here's what matters: scan quality with clear, sharp images and accurate edge detection, OCR recognition that converts printed text into editable digital text, security with encryption and biometric access to protect your data, offline mode to scan IDs without internet connection, cross-platform support that works smoothly on both Android and iPhone, organization with labels, folders, and categories for easy management, and file formats that save scans as PDFs or images.

        How to scan your ID
      </ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        It takes less than a minute. No special equipment needed. Install a scanner app like Folio Wallet, Adobe Scan, or Microsoft Lens. Open the app and select "Scan ID" or "Document" mode. Place your ID on a flat surface with good lighting. Avoid reflections. Align the ID within the guide frame. Most apps detect edges automatically. Hold steady and let the app capture the image. Review, crop if needed, then save as PDF or image. Store in an encrypted wallet app like Folio for extra security.

        On iPhone, Notes has basic scanning. On Android, Google Drive offers similar features. But dedicated ID scanner apps deliver better accuracy and organization.

      </ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        When you scan a passport, driver's license, or ID card, you're trusting the app with sensitive information. Look for encryption. Check if data stays on your device or uploads to servers. Review the privacy policy before scanning anything confidential. Folio Wallet uses zero-knowledge encryption. Even we can't read your files. You control sharing with revocable links. For documents that matter, that's the level of protection you want. Avoid free apps that display ads or require unnecessary permissions. Choose trusted options with transparent policies and verified security standards.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        For better scans, use good lighting with natural light or a bright lamp and avoid shadows and glare. Place your ID on a flat surface with a contrasting background. Keep it flat and centered. Hold your phone steady for sharper results. Use a scanner app instead of just taking a photo. A dedicated app enhances clarity and readability. Always store IDs in an encrypted app or folder. Back up regularly by saving important PDFs to a secure cloud service.
