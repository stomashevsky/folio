      <ArticleParagraph>
        Your passport is one of your most valuable documents. Losing it abroad can turn a vacation into a bureaucratic nightmare. That's why travelers have long kept photocopies as backup. Now, digital passport copies offer the same safety net with better accessibility and, if done right, stronger security.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        But storing passport data digitally raises questions. Is it legal? Is it safe? What's the right way to do it? Understanding the answers helps you protect yourself while traveling without creating new risks.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleH2>Is storing a digital passport copy legal?</ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        Yes, keeping a personal copy of your own passport for backup purposes is legal in virtually all jurisdictions. You're not creating a fraudulent document or attempting to deceive anyone. You're simply maintaining a reference copy of your own information.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        However, some important caveats apply:
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ul className="block font-normal leading-6 relative shrink-0 text-[#0a0a0a] text-base w-full space-y-2 pl-6 list-disc">
        <li><strong>Personal use only</strong>: Copies are for your reference and emergencies, not for use as identification. You cannot present a photo of your passport as if it were the original document.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't modify</strong>: Any alteration to passport data creates legal issues regardless of intent.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent for others</strong>: Storing copies of family members' passports requires their consent (or parental authority for minors).</li>
        <li><strong>Respect data protection</strong>: In some jurisdictions, passport data qualifies as sensitive personal information with specific handling requirements.</li>
      </ul>

      <ArticleH2>When you need passport copies</ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        Passport copies serve several practical purposes:
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Emergency replacement</strong>: If your passport is lost or stolen abroad, having the details readily available speeds up the replacement process at your embassy or consulate.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Hotel check-ins</strong>: Many hotels require passport information for registration. A digital copy lets you provide details without handing over your physical passport.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Visa applications</strong>: Online visa applications often require passport scans. Having a quality digital copy ready saves time.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Rental agreements</strong>: Car rental companies, apartment rentals, and other services may request passport copies for their records.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Travel companions</strong>: When traveling with others, having access to everyone's passport details helps with bookings and emergencies.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleH2>Insecure storage methods to avoid</ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        Many common storage methods create unnecessary risk:
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Email attachments</strong>: Emailing passport scans to yourself creates copies on mail servers, potentially accessible to email provider employees, hackers, or through account compromise.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Unencrypted cloud storage</strong>: Standard cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox basic) isn't designed for sensitive documents. Files may be accessible to service employees or exposed in breaches.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Photo galleries</strong>: Your phone's photo library often syncs to cloud services and may be visible to apps with photo access permissions.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Screenshots</strong>: Screenshots end up in photo libraries with the same risks, plus they often have lower quality than proper scans.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Social media messaging</strong>: Never send passport images through social platforms, even in direct messages. These are among the least secure channels available.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleH2>Best practices for secure storage</ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        Secure passport storage requires attention to several factors:
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Use end-to-end encryption</strong>: Store passport data only in services where encryption keys remain on your devices. The service provider should have no ability to access your data.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Enable strong authentication</strong>: Protect access to your storage with strong passwords and biometric authentication (Face ID, fingerprint).
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Capture quality scans</strong>: Take clear, well-lit photos of all passport pages that contain information. Include the data page, any visa stamps, and entry/exit stamps relevant to your current travels.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Keep data current</strong>: Update your digital copy when you get a new passport or add significant visas.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Ensure offline access</strong>: Your backup should be accessible even without internet connectivity. An encrypted local copy or offline-capable app ensures access when you need it most.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleH2>What to store alongside your passport</ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        A complete travel document backup includes more than just your passport:
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Embassy contact information</strong>: Phone number and address of your country's embassy or consulate at your destination.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Travel insurance details</strong>: Policy number, emergency contact numbers, and coverage summary.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Flight and hotel confirmations</strong>: Booking references and confirmation numbers.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Credit card information</strong>: Card numbers and bank contact information (stored separately from the cards themselves).
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Emergency contacts</strong>: Family members or friends who can assist in emergencies.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleH2>Responding to passport loss abroad</ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        If you lose your passport while traveling:
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Report the loss</strong>: File a police report immediately. You'll need this for the embassy and insurance claims.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Contact your embassy</strong>: They can issue emergency travel documents. Your digital passport copy will expedite this process.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Notify your bank</strong>: If your passport was stolen along with other items, alert your bank to watch for fraud.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Contact travel insurance</strong>: Many policies cover passport replacement costs and related expenses.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        Having your passport details in a secure digital wallet transforms this stressful situation. Instead of trying to remember passport numbers and issue dates, you can provide accurate information immediately, speeding up the replacement process significantly.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleH2>Storing passport data in Folio</ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <a href="/#get-the-app" className="underline hover:text-[#737373] transition-colors">Folio's digital wallet app</a> is designed for exactly this use case. When you add your passport, Folio extracts key information (name, number, expiry date) and stores everything with end-to-end encryption that prevents anyone except you from accessing your data.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        Your passport appears in a clean, readable format alongside your other travel documents: visas, boarding passes, hotel confirmations. Everything syncs across your devices while remaining encrypted, so you have secure access wherever you are.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        Digital passport copies are a smart precaution for any traveler. The key is storing them securely. Avoid casual methods like email and unencrypted cloud storage. Instead, use purpose-built solutions with strong encryption. Your passport data deserves the same protection as your physical passport: kept secure, accessible only to you, and ready when you need it.
