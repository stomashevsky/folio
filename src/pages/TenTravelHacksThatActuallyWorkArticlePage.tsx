      <ArticleH2>Travel hacks that actually work</ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Turn layovers into bonus trips.</strong> Many airlines let you extend layovers at no extra cost. Instead of rushing through an airport, spend a day exploring another city. Airlines like TAP Air Portugal, Turkish Airlines, and Qatar Airways even encourage this with stopover programs. Call when booking. Ask to move your second leg to the next day. The price usually stays the same.

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Book early, rebook often.</strong> Hotels and car rentals often allow free cancellation. Book early to secure your spot. Then keep checking back. If the price drops or you spot a better room, rebook and cancel the original. Some travelers check every few days before their trip. The savings add up.

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Pack less, travel lighter.</strong> Pack items you don't mind discarding during your trip. Old t-shirts. Worn socks. Clothes you're ready to replace. You'll lighten your load as you go. And make space for souvenirs. Merino wool shirts that dry overnight help too. Less laundry. More freedom.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Travel in the shoulder season.</strong> High season means crowds. Inflated prices. Worn-out staff. The shoulder season, just before or after peak, offers better weather, fewer tourists, and better service. Aim for the month before high season begins. Restaurants are reopening. Attractions are fresh. Prices are lower.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Be kind at the airport.</strong> A smile and kind words go a long way. Travelers report scoring exit row seats, child-free zones, and surprise upgrades simply by being polite. Treat airline staff like humans, not obstacles. The goodwill can turn into extra legroom. Or perks you didn't expect.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Go carry-on only.</strong> Skipping checked luggage saves time and stress. No waiting at baggage claim. No lost luggage drama. Easier mobility through busy cities. Create a capsule wardrobe where all pieces mix and match. You can always do laundry abroad. Most hotels have laundry service. Or find a local laundromat.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Use the right apps.</strong> The right apps transform how you travel. Set them up before you leave. You'll be covered the moment you land. TripIt builds your itinerary from email confirmations. <a href="/#get-the-app" className="underline hover:text-[#0a0a0a] transition-colors">Folio Wallet</a> organizes tickets, bookings, and documents into a secure trip timeline. E-SIM apps like Airalo let you buy local data plans digitally. Skip SIM card hassles.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Pack multipurpose items.</strong> Simple items solve multiple problems. A trash bag keeps backpacks dry in the rain. A scarf doubles as a blanket or sunshade. A pop-up laundry hamper keeps your hotel room organized. Think in layers. Each item you pack should have at least two uses. Less stuff. More versatility.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Back up everything.</strong> Losing a passport or getting stuck without Wi-Fi can ruin a trip. Prevent disaster by preparing backups. Store copies of your passports and tickets securely in Folio Wallet. Use Google Maps Offline to download maps before you go. Snap a picture of your luggage for easier claims.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Use points strategically.</strong> Loyalty points and miles stretch your budget. Especially if you're flexible. Award rates and cash fares fluctuate. Checking regularly can score major savings. Use points when prices spike. Pay cash when rates dip. Always re-check before your trip. Flexibility pays off.

        Travel hacks don't need to be complicated. The best ones are simple. Practical. Tested by real travelers. Whether it's using an e-SIM, booking in the shoulder season, or politely asking for a seat upgrade, these strategies make your next trip smoother. More enjoyable. Less stressful.
