      <ArticleParagraph>
        Family travel multiplies both the joy and the logistics. Every family member needs a passport. Everyone has their own boarding pass. Hotel reservations list multiple guests. Medical cards, travel insurance, and emergency contacts add to the stack. Keeping all this organized while managing kids at the airport tests even the most prepared parents.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        The solution isn't more folders or better filing systems. It's centralizing everything in one secure, accessible place where any family member can find what they need when they need it.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleH2>The family document challenge</ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        Consider what a family of four needs for an international trip:
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ul className="block font-normal leading-6 relative shrink-0 text-[#0a0a0a] text-base w-full space-y-2 pl-6 list-disc">
        <li><strong>Identity documents</strong>: Four passports, possibly visas, maybe national ID cards for certain destinations.</li>
        <li><strong>Travel tickets</strong>: Multiple flight segments mean eight or more boarding passes, plus train or ferry tickets.</li>
        <li><strong>Accommodations</strong>: Hotel confirmations, vacation rental details, check-in instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Medical information</strong>: Health insurance cards, vaccination records, prescription details, allergy information.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency contacts</strong>: Embassy information, insurance emergency lines, family contacts back home.</li>
        <li><strong>Activity bookings</strong>: Tour reservations, museum tickets, restaurant bookings, car rental confirmations.</li>
      </ul>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        Traditional approaches struggle with this volume. Physical folders get bulky. Email inboxes turn into search challenges. Forwarding everything to one person creates a single point of failure.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleH2>What you actually need access to</ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        Different documents matter at different times:
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>At check-in</strong>: Passports for everyone, flight confirmation, any required travel documents (visas, health declarations).
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>At security</strong>: Boarding passes, sometimes ID for adults.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>At boarding</strong>: Boarding passes, seat assignments.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>At hotel check-in</strong>: Reservation confirmation, possibly passport copies for registration.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>During activities</strong>: Booking confirmations, membership cards, entrance tickets.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>In emergencies</strong>: Insurance details, medical information, embassy contacts, copies of all critical documents.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        The key insight: you need rapid access to specific documents at specific moments, not a general archive to search through.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleH2>Digital organization strategies</ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        Effective family document management follows several principles:
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>One central location</strong>: All travel documents for all family members should live in a single, accessible place. Searching multiple apps, email accounts, and folders defeats the purpose.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Organized by trip</strong>: Group documents by journey rather than by person. When you need the Barcelona hotel confirmation, you shouldn't have to remember whose email it was sent to.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Accessible to multiple people</strong>: Both parents (and possibly older kids) should be able to access critical documents. One person holding all the information creates problems if they're delayed or incapacitated.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Available offline</strong>: Airport WiFi is unreliable. International data is expensive. Documents must be accessible without connectivity.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Secure</strong>: Passport data, medical information, and financial details require protection. Convenience shouldn't come at the cost of security.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleH2>Setting up shared access</ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        The best family document systems allow controlled sharing:
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Shared folders</strong>: Create spaces where designated family members can view (and optionally add) documents. Each person sees the shared collection alongside their personal documents.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Ownership remains clear</strong>: Documents stay owned by whoever added them. Sharing grants access without transferring control.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Real-time updates</strong>: When one person adds a booking confirmation or updates a reservation, others see the change immediately.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Permission control</strong>: Choose who can view versus who can add documents. Kids might need view access but shouldn't be editing travel plans.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleH2>Children's documents</ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        Managing children's travel documents has unique considerations:
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Expiry tracking</strong>: Children's passports expire sooner than adults' in many countries. Set reminders well before expiration.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Photo currency</strong>: Children's appearances change rapidly. A toddler's passport photo may look nothing like them by age four. Keep recent photos alongside official documents for identification purposes.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Medical records</strong>: Vaccination records, allergy information, and medication lists are especially important for children. These should be instantly accessible.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Consent documents</strong>: If traveling with only one parent, some destinations require notarized consent from the other parent. Keep these with other travel documents.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleH2>Preparing for emergencies</ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        Family travel emergencies range from minor (lost boarding pass) to serious (medical emergency or lost passport). Preparation makes all the difference:
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Complete document copies</strong>: Store copies of all passports, not just the data pages. Visa stamps and entry stamps may be relevant.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Emergency contact list</strong>: Embassy contact information for each destination. Insurance emergency lines. Family contacts who aren't traveling. All immediately accessible.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Medical summary</strong>: Blood types, allergies, medications, and doctor contact information for each family member. This could be critical in an emergency room.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Know what's where</strong>: In an emergency, you need documents immediately. Practice finding critical documents so access becomes automatic.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleH2>Before your trip</ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        A pre-departure checklist keeps family travel smooth:
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Verify passport validity</strong>: Many countries require passports valid for six months beyond your stay. Check requirements well in advance.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Update expired documents</strong>: Medical cards, travel insurance, and ID cards all have expiration dates. Verify everything is current.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Download for offline access</strong>: Ensure all documents are available offline before leaving reliable connectivity.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Share access</strong>: Confirm all relevant family members have access to shared documents.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <strong>Charge devices</strong>: Phones holding your documents need battery. Pack chargers and consider portable batteries for long travel days.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleH2>Managing documents with Folio</ArticleH2>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        <a href="/#get-the-app" className="underline hover:text-[#737373] transition-colors">Folio's digital wallet app</a> is built for exactly this scenario. Each family member can store their personal documents (passports, IDs, medical cards), then create shared folders where trip documents live together.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        Add tickets by forwarding confirmation emails or photographing documents. Folio extracts key details and organizes them into a clean travel timeline. Everyone with folder access sees the same current information.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        Everything syncs across devices while remaining end-to-end encrypted. You get the convenience of shared access with the security your documents deserve. At the airport, at the hotel, or in an emergency, the right document is always a few taps away.
      </ArticleParagraph>

      <ArticleParagraph>
        Family travel should be about the experiences, not the logistics. With proper document organization, you spend less time searching through emails and more time enjoying the journey together.
